# Autonomous Drone System for Disaster Response

## Project Overview

This project aims to develop an autonomous drone system designed to assist in disaster response scenarios.

## Key Objectives

1. **Rapid Area Mapping**

   - Quickly map large areas affected by natural disasters.

2. **Human Presence Detection**

   - Identify and log human presence and the time of detection.

3. **Real-time Data Transmission**

   - Provide rescuers with real-time data and imagery.

4. **Autonomous Navigation**
   - Enable the drone to navigate autonomously in complex environments.

## Hardware Components

- **Drone Frame, Motors, and ESCs**
- **Flight Controller**
- **GPS Module and IMU**
- **High-resolution Camera for Detailed Mapping**
- **LiDAR/Ultrasonic Sensors for Obstacle Detection**
- **Thermal Camera to Detect Human Presence**
- **4G/LTE Module for Real-time Data Transmission**
